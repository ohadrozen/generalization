# *this system of competitive bidding eliminated the right of grantees to a hearing*: it has been my lifelong dream to be allowed the unique opportunity; using blackmail and bribery typically enabled non-competitive bidders the last minute opportunity; no solicitation applicant was denied the opportunity to receive full disclosure information; 
# *to contest a funding decision awarding a grant to a competitor*: to discourage a fully open pool with applicants from different fields; inspiring bidders to craft elaborate and sometimes unnecessarily complex bids; opening up the organization to immeasurable vulnerabilities in future projects; 
# *ensuring lsc can*: but we can't; so bob could; exposing no occasion; 
# *the best applicants*: anyone it likes; the most deserving students; a worthy research institute; 
# *grants*: some virtue; the work; advancing placement; 
# *without unnecessary administrative barriers*: to promote the firm.; quickly and easily; as well as priority access to publicity portals;
